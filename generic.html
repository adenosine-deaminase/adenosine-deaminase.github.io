                <h1>Predicting NASDAQ indexes <br/>
                    during the COVID-19 pandemic</h1>
                <p>Covid-19, the most significant "black swan incident" in 2020, seemed to add huge uncertainties to the
                    stock market. Between 20 February 2020 and ended on 7 April, the global stock market experienced the
                    fastest fall in financial history and the most devastating crash since the Wall Street Crash of
                    1929. NASDAQ indexes, one kind of critical stock indexes in the US stock market, were no
                    exception.</p>


            </header>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <h3>Background</h3>


            <p>There are countless factors influencing the stock market. It’s impossible to study them exhaustively.
                Here we try to study several aspects including Google Trends and covid-19 situation (new
                cases/deaths).</p>
            <p>Google Trends provides a time series index of the volume of queries users enter into Google in a given
                geographic data. Depending on the time range, the data was normalized to [0,100]. Google trends data are
                available. Furthermore, the search queries were classified into 25 categories on the top level, 274 on
                the second level, and 629 on the third level, providing an abundant database for us to analyze what
                people are concerning during a certain time period.
            </p>
            <p>Previous researches show that the addition of relevant Google Trends predictors to the random-work model
                for initial claims for unemployment benefits in the US seemed to help in identifying at least two of the
                turning points in the series and showed reduced mean absolute error (MAE) during the recession though
                the total MAE was higher.<a
                        href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1475-4932.2012.00809.x?casa_token=8z--raqCRj8AAAAA%3A1fYgiS4CJi8SE5BhL8EG4pJcFrQMct5X2ILG0Z5gaMmE1e6tPruBJOEfsBfJZIoRXFxFkvwkt3v6WNs">[1]</a>
                Here we conduct similar analysis on NASDAQ indexes, especially in the year
                of 2020. We will focus on the influence of Google trends while also looking at two significant numbers
                that we’ve been concerning for almost one year -- the new Covid-19 cases and deaths.
            </p>

            <h3>Research Questions
            </h3>
            <p>How does the AR-1 Model perform on predicting NASDAQ indexes?
            </p>
            <p>There are many queries on google whose time series seem to be related with the covid situation. Do they
                help to improve the performance of the AR-1 model?
            </p>
            <p>Among all the Google Trends categories, which are good predictors of NASDAQ indexes?
            </p>

            <h2>(2015-2020) Predicting NASDAQ-healthcare
            </h2>
            <p>In this section we study the performance of AR-1 models on predicting the NASDAQ-Healthcare index
                (^IXHC).
            </p>
            <h3>Dataset
            </h3>
            <p>At first, we chose two NASDAQ indexes: NASDAQ-Healthcare (^IXHC) and NASDAQ-Biotech (^NBI) based on a
                naive thought that those indexes might be to more extent related to Covid-19. The time range was set as
                2015/12/01~2020/12/01 with resolution of one week. As shown below, These two indexes seemed to be one
                the same boat, rising and falling together. Hence we only took NASDAQ-Healthcare in the following
                regression analysis.
            </p>

            <iframe frameborder="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0"
                    width="100%" height="500" src="plots/NASDAQ-std.html">
            </iframe>

            <h2>Regression Analysis</h2>
            <h3>Baseline model</h3>
            <p>As Nelson and Plosser (1982) and many subsequent authors have pointed out, it is very common for
                macroeconomic data to be represented as a random walk. For a random walk, the best univariate forecast
                for y_{t} is simply y_{t-1}.</p>

            <h3>Trends Model</h3>
            <p>The trends model is simply the random walk model with google trends data on the topic vaccine being an
                additional feature.</p>
            <p>It seems that in the long run (5 years in our case), Google Trends on the topic vaccine is likely to make
                no contribution to the random walk model.
            </p>
            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <iframe frameborder="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0"
                    width="100%" height="500" src="plots/out_of_sample_5years.html">
            </iframe>
            <p>In summary, in this section we evaluated the performance of the AR-1 model on predicting
                NASDAQ-Healthcare index in recent 5 years. Results showed that the best univariate predictor is just the
                one-step-ahead value i.e. random walk model. When playing with additional predictors on the AR-1 model,
                we found that the NASDAQ-Biotech index slightly improved the random walk model fit while the Google
                trends on the topic vaccine seemed to have no contribution to the model which is in contrary to our
                intuition. Our next step is to study the influence of more Google Trends topics and the covid
                cases/deaths on the AR-1 Model in the year 2020.
            </p>

            <h2>(2020) Predicting NASDAQ-composite</h2>

            <p>In this section we study the performance of AR-1 models on predicting the NASDAQ-Composite index (^IXIC)
                in 2020. More additional predictors were studied.
            </p>
            <h3>Dataset</h3>
            <p>From now on, we study the NASDAQ-Composite index (^IXIC). The time range was set as 2015/12/01~2020/12/01
                with resolution of one day. In order to explore the changes of the stock market as far as possible, we
                utilize the COVID-19 data in the US and focus on the new cases.</p>
            <p>We also came out with 9 Google Trends topics that might influence the stock market in 2020. Both trends
                in the US and worldwide were obtained to see if there’s any difference since the NASDAQ index
                characterizes the US market.
            </p>

            <h3>Regression Analysis</h3>
            <p>We did a rolling-window prediction where the training set we determined as the all the data before day
                t. The startpoint of prediction was set as 2020/02/01 to ensure that there are enough data points to
                predict
                the first value.</p>
            <p>We can see that the deaths model has ~5% smaller total MAE than the other two models.
            </p>


            <p>
                We then take a look at the MAE values at 4 turning points in 2020 which were specified in the following
                figure:
            </p>

            <iframe frameborder="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0"
                    width="100%" height="500" src="plots/turningpoints_2020.html">
            </iframe>

            <p>We could see that only the deaths model shows less MAE than the base model during all the four turning
                points.</p>


            <p>We can see that the Google Trends on the topic lockdown among the world has a rather low p-value compared
                with other predictors.

                We also compared the total MAE of trends model with that of base model. The improvement ratio was
                plotted:
            </p>
            <iframe frameborder="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0"
                    width="100%" height="500" src="plots/improvements_2020.html">
            </iframe>
            <p>We could see that Google Trends on topics such as covid (in the world and the US), vaccine (in the
                world), and loan (in the US) improved the total MAE.

                We also did a turning-point MAE analysis on the trends models. The following figure plots the
                improvement of MAE compared with base model for each trends model:
            </p>


            <iframe frameborder="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0"
                    width="100%" height="500" src="plots/turningimprovements_2020_1.html">
            </iframe>
            <p>In the first period, Google Trends topic Italy shows the largest improvement of MAE. That period
                corresponds to the first peak of Google Trends on the topic Italy, which might be related to the rapidly
                increasing Covid-19 cases reported in Italy.</p>

            <iframe frameborder="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0"
                    width="100%" height="500" src="plots/turningimprovements_2020_2.html">
            </iframe>
            <p>In the second period, Italy also shows the largest improvement. Interestingly, the US presidential
                election also improved the MAE. Referring to the Google Trends data on the election, we could see a
                small peak in that period.</p>

            <iframe frameborder="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0"
                    width="100%" height="500" src="plots/turningimprovements_2020_3.html">
            </iframe>
            <p>In the third period, lockdown produced the largest increase of MAE but this is hard to explain because
                there were no obvious change on the Trends about lockdown in that period.
            </p>
            <iframe frameborder="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0"
                    width="100%" height="500" src="plots/turningimprovements_2020_4.html">
            </iframe>
            <p>In the 4th period, it seems that no trends significantly increased the MAE, however, the election
                produced the largest decrease of MAE, which might indicate that the public concern on election itself is
                not a good predictor for NASDAQ index because because it might originates from both good news and bad
                news about the election.
            </p>
            <p>To make it clearer, we plot the improvement of MAE for each trends model at 4 turning points as shown
                below:</p>
            <div class="image main"><img src="plots/separated_features.jpg" alt=""/></div>
            <p>We can see that only queries related with Italy, no matter in the US or the world, show significant
                improvement of MAE during the first turning point though there exists relatively small improvements of
                MAE during the 4 periods.
            </p>

            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>In summary, in this section we evaluated the performance of the AR-1 model on predicting NASDAQ-Composite
                index in 2020. Results showed that the addition of deaths due to Covid-19 increased the MAE during the
                whole period and the 4 turning points compared with the random walk model while the model added with new
                cases of Covid-19 does not. We also studied the google trends of 9 topics. We found that ‘covid’
                improves the total MAE best while ‘Italy’ improves the MAE significantly at the first turning point
                which corresponds to the onset of Covid-19 pandemic in Italy.</p>

            <h2>(2020) Predicting NASDAQ-composite</h2>

            <p>After zooming into specific topics , we’d like to take a step further and expand our research objects to
                more general topics in order to find which aspects of life are more likely to improve NASDAQ
                predictions. Before we do any data analysis, we download all levels of google trends topics in 2020 and
                conduct data wrangling to meet our needs.</p>

            <p>First, we again set our model as basic AR-1 model. Each time we add one google trends variable into
                out-sample regression and make a comparison with our base model by calculating MAE and ratio of
                improvement.
            </p>
            <p>To our surprise, a large proportion of topics having good performances are about entertainment and
                leisure in life which may indicate that during the epidemic period, people miss social and outdoor
                activities and are very eager to find more brand new ways to entertain themselves.Their desire for past
                collective life causes changes to their behavior which has an indirect impact on stock price.
            </p>
            <p>What’s more, we find from the table below, that the search for vulnerable groups also has a great impact
                for improving predictions. It makes sense since the old and weak are more likely to get infected by
                corona and need more attention and care.
            </p>
            <p>In order to find which topics combined together can fit well with our model. We used a Bayesian method
                known as ‘spike and slab’ regression introduced in Predicting the Present with Google Trends . This
                method assumes every variable has an extra coefficient according to Bernoulli distribution which shows
                how suitable the variable should enter a regression. MCMC algorithm is applied to calculate the
                posterior distribution of all coefficients.
            </p>
            <div class="image main"><img src="plots/slab.png"/></div>
            <p>We first use the topics from the first level(the most general one) and do the sampling for 5000 times.
                News, Reference, Internet & Telecom, Pets & Animals, Health are the five topics which are most likely to
                enter the regression. We then take subtopics from them and run the algorithm again. Broadcast & Network
                News and Aging & Geriatrics are most influential topics. Finally, for the bottom level. we find the
                spike and slab technique assigned high posterior probabilities to political polls & Surveys and
                Campaigns & Elections which is not surprised because 2020 U.S. election has large impact on stock. </p>
            <div class="image main"><img src="plots/slabfeatures.jpg" alt=""/></div>
            <p>From the analysis above, Leisure, Healthcare, Politics are three main topics in this unprecedented year.
                In fact, we believe they are not only good indicators of Stock but also a strong sketching of what we
                are experiencing now. </p>
