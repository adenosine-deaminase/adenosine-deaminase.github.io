            <h2>Google Trends vs. Stock Market</h2>
            <p>
                Google Trends provides a time series index of the volume of queries users enter into Google in a given
                geographic data. Depending on the time range, the data was normalized to [0,100]. Google trends data are
                available.
                Furthermore, the search queries were classified into 25 categories on the top level, 274 on the second
                level, and
                629 on the third level, providing an abundant database for us to analyze what people are concerning
                during a certain
                time period.
            </p>

            <p>
                So which topics are good indicators of the NASDAQ index? By intuiation, the queries about the index
                itself, the
                stock market, and words like "recession" seem to be strongly related to the situation of the stock
                market. Let's
                plot the Google Trends about
                <b>Recession</b>
                ,
                <b>Stock Market</b>
                , and
                <b>NASDAQ</b>
                in recent 5 years.

                The three main peaks in
                <b>Stock Market</b>
                and
                <b>NASDAQ</b>
                were on Nov 2016, Feb 2018, and Mar 2020, each time period correpsonding to impacting news about the
                stock market.
                On Nov 2016,

                and Mar 2020, the market plunged. We can see that these Google Trends do refelct people's concern on the
                stock
                market. But the question is, are they good predictors of the NASDAQ index?

            <h2> Naive Regression Analysis on Past 5 Years</h2>
            <p>
                We build naive auto regression (AR) models on the close value of NASDAQ composite index in recent 5
                years. The
                baseline model contains only the one-step-ahead value as the predictor. Then we add the one-step-ahead
                values of the
                aformentioned 3 Google Trends repectively to see if the performance could be improved. The results are

            <p>
                Take a close at the baseline model, we couls see that the coefficient of the lagged term is very close
                to 1, which
                indicates a random-walk behavior of the NASDAQ index. This is consistent with the observation and
                discussion made in
                <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1475-4932.2012.00809.x?casa_token=8z--raqCRj8AAAAA%3A1fYgiS4CJi8SE5BhL8EG4pJcFrQMct5X2ILG0Z5gaMmE1e6tPruBJOEfsBfJZIoRXFxFkvwkt3v6WNs">[1]</a>
                .
            </p>

            <hr/>
            <blockquote>
                <p>As Nelson and Plosser (1982) and many subsequent authors have pointed out, it is very
                    common for macroeconomic data to be represented as a random walk. For a random walk,
                    the best univariate forecast for y<sub>t</sub> is simply y<sub>t-1</sub>.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <hr/>

            <p>
                Despite the random-work behavior, we could observe that in the long run (in our case, 5 years), only
                Google Trends
                data about NASDAQ, Stock market, and Recession all can bring tiny improvement to the models separately
                with
                convincing p-value.
            </p>

            <p>
                Next, we'll take a look at out-of-sample forecasting. Data from 1st Dec 2015 to the one-step ahead time
                is used to train the model based on which the close value of NASDAQ index was predicted. The plot below
                demonstrates the actual NASDAQ index along with the out-of-sample predictions from both
                baseline model and trends models.

            <p>
                Eh...because NASDAQ index basically follows the random walk pattern as we said before,
                we can hardly tell distinct differences among these plots. So, we calculated the mean absolute error
                (MAE) for
                more insights:

            </table>

            <p>
                The table shows that Google Trends data about "Stock market" and "NASDAQ" both gain about 2% improvement
                compared to
                baseline model. This means it's feasible to do a better prediction for NASDAQ with the help of Google
                Trends.
            </p>

            <hr/>
            <h2>What happened in 2020?</h2>
            <p>
                From previous analysis we've known that Google Trends data could improve predictions of NASDAQ index in
                spite of its
                random-walk habit. But more detailed discovers are still waiting. For example, in 2020, a special but
                weird year,
                which trends affects the NASDAQ most? Does COVID-19 appeal to the finance people?
            </p>
            <p>
                So in this part, we collect more Google Trends in 2020. It' hard to figure out wheter they are related
                to NASDAQ in
                a intuiative way. Let's play with these trends on the NASDAQ close value in 2020 using AR model.
            </p>

            <h3>Let's make a hodgepodge of Google Trends: </h3>
            <p>
                Since the time range and resolution have been changed, we first look at the baseline model and a
                "hodgepodge" model
                including all the Google Trends data we've collected and the lagging term 'NASDAQ.l1'. The R2 values of
                these two
                models are 0.987 and 0.988, respectively. Though slightly improving the R2, the "hodgepodge" model can
                be bad at
                prediction. Larger coefficient probably means it has some outliers that may influence the NASDAQ a lot.
                Just out of
                out of curiosity, we can't wait to see which trends data has such magic.
            </p>

                    </span>

            <p>
                It's election, a event that only lasted for several weeks but left an indelible impact on the NASDAQ
                index. Note that close.l1 in the plot represents the closing prices of NASDAQ index in the previous day.
                It's always closed
                to 1.0 no matter how many trends categories we use.
            </p>
            <p>
                OK, let's go back to the main topic in out-of-sample forecasting to explore which the best predictor is.
            </p>

            <h3>Which trend is the best predictor in 2020?</h3>
            <p>
                Similar to what we've done to the 5-year data, we calculate the MAEs of the out-of-sample predictions
                made by AR
                models with only one lagging term and one Google Trends term as predictor and compare their improvements
                compared
                with the naive univariate AR-model
            </p>

            <p>
                There you go. COVID-19, the most important event in the whole world, does have the most significant
                impact on the
                future trend of NASDAQ index in 2020.
            </p>

            <p>
                But wait, as stock market is vulnerable to special event, it might not be enough to draw a conclusion
                just with
                analysis in the whole year.
            </p>

            <h3>How about the turning points?</h3>
            <p>
                Turning points are also valuable study subjects. Researchers in economics always hope to find vital
                elements in such
                turning periods to prepare the dramatic changes in the future. Here, we choose 4 turining points to dive
                in.

                For each turning period we calculate and compare the MAE improvements
            </p>

                    </span>
            <p>
                This period could be recognized as the onset of the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. During this period,
                Google Trends
                topic Italy shows the largest improvement of MAE. At the same time, Google Trends on the topic Italy
                showed its
                fisrt peak in 2020, which might be related to the rapidly increasing COVID-19 cases reported in Italy.
            </p>

            <h4>Period 2: 2020-03-10 ~ 2020-03-30</h4>

                    </span>
            <p>
                This is a tragic period where the US stock market unprecedentedly fused 4 times in 10 days due to its
                plunge. During
                this period, Italy also shows the largest improvement. Interestingly, the US presidential election also
                improved the
                MAE. Referring to the Google Trends data on the election, we could see a small peak in that period.
            </p>

            <h4>Period 3: 2020-08-20 ~ 2020-09-15</h4>
            <!--插入Part_II的第六张图，第三个转折点-->

                    </span>
            <p>
                During this period, lockdown produced the largest increase of MAE but this is hard to explain because
                there were no
                obvious change on the Trends about lockdown during this period.
            </p>

            <h4>Period 4: 2020-10-10 ~ 2020-11-10</h4>
            <!--插入Part_II的第七张图，第四个转折点-->

                    </span>
            <p>
                This period is marked by the US president election. It seems that no trends significantly increased the
                MAE,
                however, the election produced the largest decrease of MAE, which might indicate that the public concern
                on election
                itself is not a good predictor for NASDAQ index because because it might bring to the stock market both
                optimisim
                and pessimism which might be switching frequently as the election went on.
            </p>
            <h4>Overall Comparison</h4>
            <p>
                After investigating each period, let's the performance of all the trends during all the tunring periods
                together:
            </p>

            <span class="image fit"><img src="plots/separated_features.png" alt=""/></span>
            <p>
                We can see that only queries related with Italy, no matter in the US or the world, show significant
                improvement of
                MAE during the first turning point though there exists relatively small improvements of MAE during the 4
                periods.
                Also the Trends on election dramatically reduces the MAE in the election period
            </p>

            <hr/>
            <h2> Which Trends are actually behind the NASDAQ? </h2>
            <p> We've already made some breakthrough in the mysterious stock market world, however not enough! Stay
                hungry!!! Let's
                dive into the whole and exciting deep sea of google trends and make a thorough exploration to see what
                happened
                indeed! </p>

            <p> Since the real world is complicated and full of uncertainties, how can we normal people know what kind
                of things are
                actually connected with stock market apart from just by guessing with our few life experiences. One of
                the answer is
                again Google trends! Google actually divides Google Trends data into hundreds of categories and 3
                hierarchical
                levels which can be easily preprocessed. With Google Trends data in all categories, we are able to
                analyze our model
                performance in all different levels.
            </p>
            <h3> Analysis for all topics</h3>
            <p> We apply the same method as before to compare ratio of improvement of MAE, but this time, all topics in
                life! To our
                surprise, a large proportion of topics having good performances are about entertainment and leisure in
                life. Top 1
                topic is "Concerts & Music Festivals" which improves our base model by 5.6%! One can immediately find
                the result is
                not by chance, Think about what happened in 2020, it's reasonable to argue that during the epidemic
                period, people
                miss social and outdoor activities and are very eager to find more brand new ways to entertain
                themselves.Their
                desire for past collective life causes changes to their behavior which has an indirect impact on stock
                price.</p>
            <h3> Relation between different levels</h3>
            <p> Let's make our analysis more hierarchical and clear. We organize and sort all topics according to their
                corresponding level. First, we want to know if the broadness of a topic has influnce on inprovement. The
                answer is
                yes. Note that <b>level 1</b> is the <b>top level</b> and <b>level 3</b> is the <b>bottom level</b>.
                From the distribution of
                improvement, We find that the more detailed a topic is, the more likely it
                is to improve our model by a lot.
                <!--分布图-->

                                width="100%" height="500" src="plots/level.html">
                        </iframe>
                    </span>
            <p> Next. we want to find out whether a topic will have better performance as long as it contains a larger
                proportion of
                subcategories that are also good predictors. However only level 2 and level 3 conform to this law,
                namely the
                "improvement ratios" are positively correlated with "positive ratios".</p>

                    </span>
            <p> Finally, after we inspect all the three levels, topics about leisure and healthcare almost dominate the
                other ones.
                For example, Aging & Geriatrics has a high rank which makes sense because the old and weak are more
                likely to get
                infected by corona and need more attention and care. </p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>NASDAQ index shows a <b>random-walk</b> behavior</li>
                <li>The AR model for predicting NASDAQ index could be improved (in terms of both in-sample R2 and
                    out-of-sample MAE)
                    by Google Trends on "NASDAQ" and "Stock Market"
                </li>
                <li>Among the 9 Google Trends in 2020, "COVID-19" improved the MAE the most among the year while Google
                    Trends on
                    "Italy" showed the greatest improvements at the first two turning points of NASDAQ index. However,
                    Google Trends
                    on "Election" increases the MAE significantly during the election period
                </li>
                <li><b>Leisure</b>, <b>Healthcare</b>, <b>Politics</b> are three good
                    indicators of Stock in this unprecedented year which is in fact a strong sketching of what we most
                    care about in
                    2020.
